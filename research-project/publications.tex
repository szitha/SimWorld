\section*{Conference presentation}

I have been fortunate enough to contribute to the field of machine learning and astronomy in the form of an
upcoming academic paper. This work has been presented in prestigious conferences such as Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2017, Machine Learning Summer School (MLSS), Argentina, Buenos Aires, 2018, as well as that of our local Deep Learning Indaba 2017 in South Africa.

NIPS is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference held  every December. This is one of the largest and most influential AI conferences where researchers gather \citep{NIPS}. 

The MLSS series was started in 2002 with the motivation to
promulgate modern methods of statistical machine learning and inference. This was motivated by the increase in the number of students and researchers wanting to learn about machine learning while few machine learning courses are being taught at universities.
Machine learning summer schools present topics that are at the core of modern machine learning, from fundamentals to state-of-the-art practice. The speakers are leading experts in their field who talk with enthusiasm about their subjects \citep{MLSS}.

The Deep Learning Indaba is one of the biggest AI conferences in Africa with the aim to help Africans to participate and contribute to the advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and diversity in these fields of science \citep{DLI}.
