The applications of machine learning have created an opportunity to deal with complex problems currently encountered in radio astronomy data processing. Calibration is one of the most important processing steps that are required to produce high dynamic range images with high fidelity. This process involves the determination of calibration parameters to correct the observed data. These parameters generally include instrumental as well as astronomical parameters. Many calibration techniques have been developed to overcome a variety of calibration problems, this includes first generation calibration (1GC), second generation calibration (2GC) and third generation calibration (3GC) using Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA). In    
this work, we present the application of machine learning methods to calibrate radio interferometric data. These methods uses data from the KAT-7 telescope sensors to perform calibration as opposed to calculating the solutions with CASA. These methods are computationally less expensive and as accurate as conventional calibration methods. This is a newly developed regression algorithm called ZCal, and is based on tree based(ensemble) and clustering machine learning methods. After the testing and validation of our models, we observe that this algorithm has learned to generalize and predict CASA-like calibration solutions. However, there is higher prediction accuracy in amplitude than phase solutions with an error $\approx$ $0.01<Err_{amplitude}<0.09$ and $0.2<Err_{phase}<0.5$. Thus more work is required in improving also for the phase predictions.
