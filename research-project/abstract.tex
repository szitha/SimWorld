The applications of machine learning have created an opportunity to deal with complex problems currently encountered in radio astronomy data processing. Calibration is one of the most important data processing steps required to produce high dynamic range images. This process involves the determination of calibration parameters, both instrumental and astronomical, to correct the
collected data. These parameters include instrumental as well as astronomical parameters. Many astronomers use Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) to compute the gain calibration solutions. In this work we present applications of machine learning to first generation calibration (1GC), using the KAT-7 telescope environmental and pointing sensor data recorded during observations. Applying machine learning to 1GC, as opposed to calculating the gain solutions in CASA, has shown evidence of reducing computation, as well as accurately predict the 1GC gain solutions and antenna behaviour. These methods are computationally less expensive and accurate in predicting the 1GC solutions and antenna behaviour. We call this multi-output regression model $\textit{ZCal}$, which is based on randomized trees and K neighbor algorithms. After the testing and validation of our models, we observe that this model has learned to generalize and predict 1GC solutions with the rms error accuracy of $\approx$ $0.01< rmse <0.09$ for gain amplitude, and $0.2< rmse<0.5$ for gain phase.
